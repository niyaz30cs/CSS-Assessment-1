        <br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML element are to be displayed od screen,or in other media.</li>
        <br>
        <li><span class="cut">Css is not neccesary</span><span class="over">CSS saves a lot of work.</span>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>

    <h2 class="head">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul class="list2">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML element</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>the most common way to add CSS. is to keep the style in external CSS file.
            <span class="over">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal style,</span> 
            because this is easier to demonstrate.and easier for you to it yourself.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <span class="list">
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the different is that CSS class applied
        a style to multiple element.ID,on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element
        ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an
        element and it's used by JavaScript.
        <p>In CSS,selector are used to target a specific element or range of element
            on a web page.Once an element has been targeted,a style or set of style can be applied to the element.
        </p>
        <p>There is a wide range of selector available.Two of tghe most commonly
            used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style
            should be applied.
